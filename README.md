# Telegram bot by Fedor Zapalatin

**Disclaimer:** this bot is just my experiment with pyTelegramBotAPI library. It's not serious project but I hope my bot will be helpful for you.

##### Requirements
- Python 3
- [pyTelegramBotAPI library](https://github.com/eternnoir/pyTelegramBotAPI)
- Linux (It will run on Windows but there will be some problems with using commands like /admin because it contains linux terminal commands)

**Attention:** to make the bot work you have to fill the "token" value in `bot_config.ini`
